# Ghidra Bridge Module (`src/ghidra/`)

Manages the Java bridge process lifecycle and Ghidra installation/setup.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bridge.rs` | Bridge process management: start, stop, status, liveness check |
| `setup.rs` | Ghidra download, installation, Java version check |
| `mod.rs` | Module root, `GhidraClient` for project/installation operations |
| `scripts/GhidraCliBridge.java` | Java bridge server (TCP, 80+ command handlers, runs inside Ghidra JVM) |

## Bridge Lifecycle

```
CLI calls ensure_bridge_running()
  |
  +-- is bridge already running? (port file + PID alive + TCP probe)
  |     yes -> return existing port
  |     no  -> clean up stale files, call start_bridge()
  |
  v
start_bridge()
  |
  1. Write GhidraCliBridge.java to ~/.config/ghidra-cli/scripts/
  2. Spawn: analyzeHeadless <project_dir> <project_name> -process [<program>] -noanalysis -preScript GhidraCliBridge.java <port_file_path>
  3. Write PID file immediately from Rust (child.id())       <-- enables orphan cleanup
  4. Read stdout line by line, wait for {"status":"ready"}
  5. Java bridge: binds ServerSocket(0), writes port file, overwrites PID file
  6. Return port number to caller
```

The bridge always launches with `-preScript -noanalysis`, so it binds its socket
right after the project (and optional program) loads — *before* any analysis —
and reports ready fast. Analysis is not part of launch; it runs afterwards as an
unbounded TCP `analyze` operation. Importing a new binary is a separate,
short-lived `analyzeHeadless -import` run that commits the program to the project
before the persistent bridge opens it in `-process` mode. Normal imports run
headless auto-analysis there; `--no-analyze` adds `-noanalysis`. Explicit loader,
language, compiler-spec, and loader arguments are also applied to this one-shot
path, which is how raw blobs are imported with `BinaryLoader`.

### PID File Write Sequence

Two writes happen to the PID file:

1. **Rust writes immediately** after `child.spawn()` -- uses the OS-level child PID. This ensures the PID file exists even if Java crashes before binding the ServerSocket, enabling cleanup of orphaned JVM processes.
2. **Java overwrites later** once the bridge binds its ServerSocket and is ready to accept connections. The Java PID value is the same process, but the write confirms the bridge reached its ready state.

The Rust write uses `.ok()` (ignores errors) because it is best-effort. The Java write is the authoritative one.

### Failure Cleanup

If the bridge fails to start (ready signal not received):

1. Check if child process is still running via `child.try_wait()`
2. If running: `child.kill()` then `child.wait()` to prevent orphaned JVM
3. Call `cleanup_stale_files()` to remove any port/PID files
4. Return error with diagnostic details from stderr/stdout

## Liveness Detection

### `is_bridge_running(project_path) -> Option<u16>`

Returns `Some(port)` if the bridge is alive, `None` otherwise. Checks in order:

1. Port file exists and contains a valid u16
2. PID file exists and contains a valid u32
3. PID is alive (`kill(pid, 0)` on Unix)
4. TCP connect to `127.0.0.1:{port}` succeeds

Returns the port directly so callers never need a separate `read_port_file()` call. This eliminates TOCTOU races where the port file could change between a liveness check and a subsequent read.

### `bridge_status(project_path) -> BridgeStatus`

Stronger verification than `is_bridge_running`: uses `BridgeClient::new(port).ping()` instead of raw TCP connect. Returns `BridgeStatus::Running { port, pid }` or `BridgeStatus::Stopped`.

### Responsive control plane and serialized program lane

Command dispatch no longer treats a failed pre-flight ping as proof that the bridge is
dead. More importantly, socket handling is now separate from Ghidra program execution:

```text
TCP acceptor -> bounded client pool -> control commands (immediate)
                                  \-> bounded FIFO -> GhidraScript thread
```

`ping`, `status`, `bridge_info`, `job_status`, `job_cancel`, and `shutdown` run on the
control plane using thread-safe snapshots. Every command that can touch `currentProgram`,
`state`, a transaction, or another Ghidra object is assigned a job ID and executed on the
original `GhidraScript.run()` thread. This keeps the conservative one-owner program model
without making a long analysis look like a dead bridge.

The explicit queue is bounded at 256 program jobs. Connection handlers only parse and
enqueue; they do not block while a program future is pending. Completed futures hand socket
writes to a separate bounded response pool, preserving the existing synchronous
request/response protocol without starving controls behind waiting clients. Status retains
the 100 most recent jobs and exposes active progress, queued work, cancellation state, and
elapsed time. Cancellation uses a per-job `TaskMonitorAdapter`; active cancellation is
cooperative, while a job that has not started can be removed from the queue immediately.

See `ipc/client.rs`: `connect_with_retry()` waits out transient connect failures (bridge
(re)start / saturated client capacity) with backoff up to
`GHIDRA_CLI_CONNECT_DEADLINE` (default 60s). A program request waits up to
`GHIDRA_CLI_READ_TIMEOUT` (default 300s; `0` = indefinite), while long analyze/import
operations use `GHIDRA_CLI_OP_TIMEOUT` (`0` or unset = indefinite). Use `ghidra jobs` to
inspect work and `ghidra cancel [JOB_ID]` to request cancellation.

`shutdown` stops accepting new work and drains every program job accepted before it. The
Rust lifecycle waits up to `GHIDRA_CLI_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` (default 300s; `0` = indefinite)
before force termination. This replaces the old three-second window that could kill a
healthy bridge while it was finishing work or closing the project.

## BridgeClient Adoption

`bridge.rs` sends no commands over TCP directly. All command communication goes through `BridgeClient` (in `src/ipc/client.rs`):

- `stop_bridge()` uses `BridgeClient::new(port).shutdown()` for graceful shutdown
- `bridge_status()` uses `BridgeClient::new(port).ping()` for liveness verification
- `is_bridge_running()` still uses raw `TcpStream::connect` for the lightweight probe (no command round-trip needed)

Rationale: `bridge.rs` originally had its own `BridgeRequest`/`BridgeResponse` structs and `send_command()`/`send_typed_command()` functions that duplicated the types and logic in `ipc/protocol.rs` and `ipc/client.rs`. Consolidating to BridgeClient eliminated ~80 lines of duplicate TCP code and the duplicate type definitions.

## Per-Project Isolation

Each project gets unique port/PID files via MD5 hash of the project path:

- **Port file**: `~/.local/share/ghidra-cli/bridge-{md5}.port`
- **PID file**: `~/.local/share/ghidra-cli/bridge-{md5}.pid`

This allows multiple bridges to run simultaneously for different projects.

## Start Modes

`BridgeStartMode` selects how the persistent bridge opens the project. Both use
`-preScript -noanalysis`; neither analyzes at launch.

| Mode | analyzeHeadless Args | Use Case |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| `Process { program_name }` | `-process <program_name> -noanalysis` | Open a specific existing program |
| `Project` | `-process -noanalysis` | Open the project without loading a program (e.g. `program list`, auto-start) |

Importing a binary is not a start mode. Fresh imports happen in a separate
short-lived `analyzeHeadless -import` run that commits the program to the project;
`--no-analyze` adds `-noanalysis`. Imports with explicit loader/language/compiler
settings always use this path as well (stopping a live bridge first if necessary),
so options such as `BinaryLoader`, `x86:LE:32:default`, and `baseAddr` reach Ghidra's
headless loader directly. The persistent bridge then opens the committed program
in `Process` mode. Best-guess imports into an already-open project may still use
the bridge's `AutoImporter` path and analyze over TCP.

## Stale File Cleanup

`cleanup_stale_files(project_path)` removes both port and PID files. Called:

- When `ensure_bridge_running` detects stale files (dead PID or unreachable port)
- When `start_bridge` fails (ready signal not received)
- When `bridge_status` finds stale files
- When `stop_bridge` completes (normal cleanup)
