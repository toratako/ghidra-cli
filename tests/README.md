# E2E Test Suite

Comprehensive end-to-end test coverage for ghidra-cli commands.

## Architecture

Tests are organized by functional area into separate files:

```
tests/
├── common/
│   ├── mod.rs           # DaemonTestHarness, fixtures, helpers
│   ├── helpers.rs       # GhidraCommand builder, GhidraResult assertions
│   └── schemas.rs       # Response validation schemas
├── daemon_tests.rs      # Bridge lifecycle: start/stop/restart/status/ping
├── project_tests.rs     # Project: create/list/delete/info
├── reliability_tests.rs # Bridge restart recovery, stale file cleanup
├── command_tests.rs     # Basic commands: version/doctor/config/init
├── comment_tests.rs     # Comment operations
├── patch_tests.rs       # Binary patching operations
├── readonly_tests.rs    # Read-only query tests
├── script_tests.rs      # Script execution
├── symbol_tests.rs      # Symbol operations
├── tag_tests.rs         # Function tag operations
├── type_tests.rs        # Type operations
├── output_format_integration.rs  # Output format detection
└── e2e.rs               # Lightweight smoke test
```

`daemon_tests` also verifies that an active script cancellation does not cancel
the next job, handlers follow Program switches/close, and a failed mutation
cannot erase earlier successful edits on restart. Java source publication and
inventory tests live in `src/ghidra/bridge/sources.rs`; the lifecycle tests cover
OSGi loading of the complete embedded source bundle.

## Per-Suite Bridge Lifecycle

Tests requiring bridge interaction use `DaemonTestHarness` from `common/mod.rs`. Each test suite starts its own bridge instance to amortize 5-30s startup overhead across all tests in that file.

**Why per-suite instead of per-test**: Starting a bridge for every test would add 5-30 minutes to CI time for 60+ tests. Per-suite bridges run tests serially within the suite but allow parallel execution across different test files.

**Why not shared global bridge**: State leakage between suites causes flaky tests and debugging nightmares. Each suite gets isolation.

## Data Flow

```
Test Suite Start
      |
      v
DaemonTestHarness::new()
      |
      +---> Start bridge (analyzeHeadless + GhidraCliBridge.java)
      +---> Wait for port file
      +---> Verify with ping
      |
      v
Run tests (serial within suite)
      |
      v
DaemonTestHarness::drop()
      |
      +---> Send shutdown command via TCP
      +---> Cleanup port/PID files
```

## Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

Run specific test suite:
```bash
cargo test --test daemon_tests
cargo test --test command_tests
```

Run single test:
```bash
cargo test --test command_tests test_version
```

Five Insta snapshot tests in `readonly_tests.rs` are marked `#[ignore]` pending
snapshot bootstrapping; their reference `.snap` files are not tracked. To execute
them without creating or accepting reference snapshots:

```bash
INSTA_UPDATE=no cargo test --test readonly_tests -- --ignored
```

These assertions fail until reference snapshots have been reviewed and added.
The normal read-only suite also checks response schemas without snapshots.

Run tests that don't need Ghidra:
```bash
cargo test --test e2e --test output_format_integration --test harness_tests
```

## Test Requirements

### Ghidra Installation

Tests assume Ghidra is installed. Use `require_ghidra!()` in tests that need a fast, explicit availability check; it panics (fails the test) if `ghidra doctor` fails.

### Test Fixtures

`fixture_binary()` compiles `tests/fixtures/sample_binary.rs` automatically with
`rustc` into a temporary directory, once per test executable. Only the source is
tracked in Git. The fixture keeps function symbols and exercises its exported functions. Debug
information is stripped to avoid expensive Rust standard-library DWARF analysis.
It uses the host executable format (including `.exe` on Windows).
No manual build step is required.

Each suite uses `common::test_project()` to select a fresh project name for every
run. Projects are never reused from a mutation suite or a previous run. Import
and bridge startup failures fail the tests rather than returning success.

## Adding New Tests

### Non-Bridge Tests

Add to appropriate file (`command_tests.rs`, `project_tests.rs`):

```rust
#[test]
fn test_my_command() {
    require_ghidra!();

    Command::cargo_bin("ghidra")
        .unwrap()
        .arg("my-command")
        .assert()
        .success();
}
```

### Bridge-Dependent Tests

Add to the appropriate test file (e.g., `symbol_tests.rs`, `readonly_tests.rs`):

```rust
#[test]
#[serial]
fn test_my_query() {
    require_ghidra!();

    ensure_test_project(common::test_project(), TEST_PROGRAM);

    let harness =
        DaemonTestHarness::new(common::test_project(), TEST_PROGRAM).expect("Failed to start bridge");

    Command::cargo_bin("ghidra")
        .unwrap()
        .arg("--project")
        .arg(common::test_project())
        .arg("my-query")
        .arg("--program")
        .arg(TEST_PROGRAM)
        .assert()
        .success();

    drop(harness);
}
```

Mark with `#[serial]` to prevent bridge state races within suite.

## Invariants

- Bridge must be fully started before any query test runs
- Each test suite gets its own bridge instance (no sharing)
- Port/PID files must be cleaned up even on test failure (Drop impl)
- Tests must not assume specific function addresses (use name-based lookups)

## Troubleshooting

### "Bridge failed to start within timeout"

Ghidra cold start can be slow. Ensure:
- Ghidra installation is valid (`ghidra doctor`)
- Sufficient disk space for temporary Ghidra project
- Not running on extremely constrained CI resources

### Fixture compilation fails

Check that `rustc` is on PATH. Compilation failures include the compiler's stderr.

### "Port already in use" / stale port files

Each test suite uses project-name-based port file paths to prevent collisions. This error suggests:
- Previous test run leaked bridge process (kill manually)
- Stale port/PID files in `~/.local/share/ghidra-cli/`

Find leaked processes:
```bash
ps aux | grep ghidra
kill <pid>
```

### Tests hang or timeout

- Check if bridge is stuck (check process list)
- Verify TCP connectivity on localhost
- Increase timeout in test (bridge startup can vary)

### Import/analysis takes too long

Tests use 300s timeout for import/analyze operations. On slow systems:
- Run fewer parallel test suites
- Ensure Ghidra has adequate heap memory
- Check disk I/O performance

## Tradeoffs

**Per-suite vs per-test bridge**: Chose speed over maximum isolation. Tests within suite are serial, but suite-to-suite parallelism maintained.

**Project-name-based port files vs random ports**: Each test suite uses a unique project name which maps to a unique port file via MD5 hash, preventing collisions.

**Testing unimplemented commands**: Adds maintenance burden but documents gaps and ensures graceful failures for stub commands.

Suite exit cleanup stops the bridge and removes the generated project and fixture.
Forced process termination can leave artifacts behind; cleanup is best effort.
