# Changelog

Release history follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `analyzer set NAME true|false` now accepts an explicit boolean and displays
  `--help` without panicking. Missing or invalid values produce argument errors.

## [0.2.2]

### Added

- **Function tags** (#17) — expose Ghidra's `FunctionTagManager` for organizing
  large codebases: `ghidra tag list|get|create|delete|rename|set-comment|add|remove`,
  plus `ghidra function list --tag NAME` (repeatable, AND semantics, filtered
  server-side) and `--untagged`. `tag add` auto-creates missing tags (strict mode
  via `--no-create`) and reports `added`/`created`/`already_present`; `tag
  remove` is likewise idempotent. `tag delete` reports both Ghidra's raw
  `use_count` and the non-external `functions_affected`. Unknown-tag lookups
  error with a `Did you mean ...?` hint instead of returning empty results.
  Function rows (`function list`/`get`) now carry a sorted `tags` array.
- `--filter` expressions now work on array-valued fields (e.g. `tags`,
  `operands`) with any-element semantics: `tags ~ 'crypto'` matches if any
  element matches; `tags != 'x'` means NO element equals `x`. Previously such
  filters silently matched nothing.
- `ghidra disasm-at ADDRESS [--count N]` — disassemble at an address,
  disassembling first if no instruction is there yet, and report whether an
  instruction actually landed there (`ok`/`landed`), since `disassemble()` can
  report success with nothing landing at the target.
- `ghidra function create ADDRESS [NAME]` now auto-disassembles at the target
  first if no instruction exists there, instead of failing outright.
- `ghidra clear START:END [--to-data] [--disasm-at ADDR]` — clear code units
  overlapping a range (undoes auto-analysis that mis-disassembled through
  inline data), optionally re-disassembling at a precise address in the same
  call.
- `ghidra function set-noreturn TARGET [--value true|false]` — mark a function
  as never returning to its call site. `no_return` and `tags` are now included
  in `function get`/`function list` output.
- `ghidra function tag add/remove/list TARGET TAG_NAME` and
  `ghidra function list --tag TAG_NAME` — native function tagging
  (Ghidra's `FunctionTagManager`/`Function.addTag`), replacing the
  `[subsys:name]` PLATE-comment convention some projects used as a workaround.
- `ghidra script run -` reads Java source from stdin for one-off scripts
  (staged to a temp file and compiled through the same path as a file on
  disk), so a throwaway snippet no longer needs a checked-in file.
  `ghidra doctor` now documents why `script python`/`script java` (inline
  eval) stay disabled.
- `ghidra type apply ADDRESS TYPE --force` (alias `--clear-conflicting`)
  clears a conflicting data unit first instead of failing on it.
- `ghidra comment set ADDRESS --stdin` / `--text-file PATH` read comment text
  outside the shell argument, avoiding silent corruption from shell
  metacharacter expansion (e.g. backticks) in free-form prose.
- Structured error detail for three previously-opaque failures — `function
  create` on an address already owned by another function (owner
  name/entry/size), `function create` when `createFunction` returns `null` or
  throws (diagnoses no-instruction vs. inside-existing-function vs.
  mid-code-unit causes), and `type apply` "Conflicting data exists" (the
  conflicting unit's kind/type/range). Printed as JSON with `-vv`/`--json`.
- `program save` flushes edits by stopping/restarting the same program: the
  headless harness's lifetime transaction prevents an in-place save. `stop`
  persists without restarting; `program close` now reports that it cannot
  perform the requested in-place save instead of silently discarding that intent.

- Responsive `ping`, `status`, `bridge_info`, `jobs`, and `cancel` use snapshots
  independently of the single Ghidra program lane. Program requests receive job
  IDs and wait in a bounded FIFO (256), replacing the invisible socket backlog.
- `ghidra jobs [JOB_ID]` — inspect the active job, the queue, and recent history
  (the bridge keeps the last 100 jobs), or one job by ID.
- `ghidra cancel [JOB_ID]` — cooperatively cancel the active job (or a specific
  one). A job that hasn't started is dropped from the queue immediately; a running
  job is cancelled via a per-job `TaskMonitor`.

### Changed

- CSV output joins array-valued cells with `;` instead of `, ` — a `, `-joined
  array inside an unquoted CSV field shifted every subsequent column (affects
  the new `tags` column plus existing in-row arrays like `operands`/`params`).
- `function list` rows gained a `tags` column, changing CSV/table headers for
  existing consumers.
- `BridgeClient::list_functions` grew `tags`/`untagged` parameters.
- `ghidra script run` runs a checked-in script by absolute path with real
  positional arguments (everything after `--`) and captured stdout, returning
  `{script, path, stdout, args}`. New `--expect PATH[:MIN_ROWS]` (repeatable) fails
  the job when an output artifact is missing, empty, or short; `--allow-empty`
  permits an expected-but-empty file. Scripts run on the cancellable job lane, so
  `ghidra cancel` works on them.

### Fixed

- Commands issued while the bridge is busy now wait in the queue instead of
  failing with "bridge not responding" — a slow analysis no longer looks like a
  dead bridge.
- Import now treats stale empty `.gpr`/`.rep` project artifacts as uninitialized
  and uses the durable one-shot import path instead of trying to start a
  project-mode bridge that Ghidra rejects because it contains no programs.
- Removed the inert legacy config key `timeout`. Old YAML files containing it
  still load, but the key is dropped when saved and `config set timeout` points
  to the active read, long-operation, connection, and launch timeout controls.
- `patch nop --count N` now NOPs N consecutive instructions (was: silently
  ignored, only the instruction at the address was patched). The client forwards
  the count and the bridge walks instruction by instruction, so variable-length
  ISAs work; if any address in the run has no instruction the whole patch rolls
  back.
- `comment set --comment-type PRE|POST|PLATE` now takes effect (was: always
  `EOL`). The client sent the type under key `type` while the bridge read
  `comment_type`; the client now sends `comment_type` and the bridge still
  accepts the old key as a fallback.
- `ghidra script run` no longer fails intermittently with "Failed to get OSGi
  bundle containing script" for `.java` scripts. Two bugs compounded: the
  bridge resolved the target script through `GhidraScriptUtil`'s ambiguous
  "first registered ancestor directory" bundle lookup instead of the exact
  bundle it had just registered, so an unrelated, broader script directory
  registered earlier (e.g. from another project) could shadow it; and a
  reflective `Class.forName()` call with a literal class-name string caused
  the bnd OSGi analyzer to add an unwireable `Import-Package` to the bridge's
  own bundle, breaking bridge startup outright. `script run` now builds and
  loads the class from the exact bundle it resolved for the script's
  directory.
- `symbol rename`/`symbol delete NAME` no longer silently mutate every symbol
  in the program sharing `NAME` (Ghidra reuses auto-generated names like
  `caseD_XX`/`LAB_XXXX` across unrelated addresses). Both now require
  `--address`/`--filter` to disambiguate a name shared by more than one
  symbol, or `--all` to explicitly opt into affecting every match; `symbol
  delete --filter` now actually scopes the deletion instead of being silently
  ignored.
- `type create` now rejects a value that isn't a bare identifier (e.g.
  `type create "struct Foo {}"`) instead of silently creating a type
  literally named after the whole unparsed string. It only ever creates an
  empty struct — build fields afterward with `type add-field`.
- `--filter "address = '0xADDR'"` (quoted, `0x`-prefixed) now matches the
  same symbol as `--filter "address = 'ADDR'"`. Address-shaped filter fields
  (`address`, `entry_point`, `from`, `to`, `min_address`, `max_address`)
  tolerate an optional `0x`/`0X` prefix on the compared value.
- `function rename OLD NEW --address ADDR` now honors the exact entry address
  and rejects an `OLD` name mismatch. Reused auto-generated names made ignoring
  the address unsafe, as with the symbol mutation fix above.
- `memory read` now resolves overlay-qualified addresses (e.g. `rom20::69f0`)
  through `resolveAddress`, replacing the default-space-only hex parser.
- `clear RANGE` no longer fails to parse overlay-qualified ranges (e.g.
  `rom1::5512:551d` or `rom1::5512:rom1::551d`) with `Invalid start address:
  rom1`. `RANGE` was split on the first `:`, which took everything before the
  `::` bank separator as the whole start address; it now splits on the `:`
  that actually separates start from end, treating `::` as a unit, and a bare
  end address inherits the start address's overlay space.
- Socket read timeout now reports `Timeout:`/exit 75 (`EX_TEMPFAIL`), distinct
  from bridge failure (`Error:`/exit 1). The job continues server-side; poll
  `ghidra jobs <id>` before retrying.

## [0.2.1]

### Fixed

- `--limit 0` now means all rows in both client pagination and bridge requests,
  fixing empty exports and accidental fallback to the 1000-row default.
- **Malformed `--filter` expressions now fail with a clear error** (was:
  the parse error was swallowed and the CLI dumped the *entire unfiltered,
  unlimited* dataset while exiting 0). A bare word like `--filter PK` is
  rejected up front — before any bridge fetch — with a hint to use
  `name~PK` (contains) or `name=~"^PK_"` (regex). The filter DSL is now
  summarized in `--help` for `--filter` and `--limit`.
- **`=~` regex filters are now case-insensitive**, matching the other string
  operators. Field values are lowercased before matching, so an uppercase
  pattern like `name=~"^PK_"` previously matched nothing, silently.
- Filter regexes are compiled once per pattern instead of once per row,
  removing a large constant cost when filtering datasets with millions of
  rows (e.g. 1.9M symbols).

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **Automatic full-JDK detection for Ghidra.** Ghidra compiles its bridge script
  at runtime and needs the `jdk.compiler` module, so a JRE (or a `jlink`-trimmed
  image) silently fails. ghidra-cli now resolves a suitable JDK itself —
  requiring `javac`, the `jdk.compiler` module, and major version ≥ Ghidra's
  minimum (21 for Ghidra 12.x) — and hands it to `analyzeHeadless` via
  `JAVA_HOME` rather than relying on Ghidra's PATH-based pick. Override with the
  `--java-home <PATH>` global flag, `java_home` config, or `GHIDRA_CLI_JAVA_HOME`.
- Global `--project` / `--program` flags — usable before any subcommand
  (e.g. `ghidra --project P --program bin function list`); previously these were
  accepted only per-subcommand.
- Global `--projects-dir <DIR>` flag (with `ghidra_project_dir` config and
  `GHIDRA_PROJECT_DIR` env) to choose where Ghidra projects are stored.
- `ghidra import --no-analyze` — import a binary without running auto-analysis
  (the program is still persisted).
- `ghidra program export` now supports the built-in Ghidra exporters in addition
  to JSON: `xml`, `c`/`cpp`, `binary`/`bin`, `gzf`, `ascii`/`asm`, `hex`, and
  `html`. Exporters are resolved by class name and 4-arg arity so they keep
  working across Ghidra versions.
- Config `launch_timeout_secs` (env `GHIDRA_CLI_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT`, default 180s) —
  bounded cap for bridge launch readiness. Env `GHIDRA_CLI_OP_TIMEOUT` caps the
  otherwise-unbounded long-running TCP ops (`analyze` / `import`).

### Changed

- `ghidra import` now runs auto-analysis by default (over TCP) and reports the
  resulting `function_count`. Use `--no-analyze` to skip it.
- `ghidra doctor` and `ghidra setup` now require and verify a **full JDK** (not
  just any Java on `PATH`): `doctor` reports the selected JDK and compiles the
  embedded bridge script as a real health check, surfacing the actual error on
  failure.
- The `ilspy-cli` companion tool was extracted into its own repository and is no
  longer part of this workspace.

### Fixed

- **`ghidra import` no longer hangs on non-trivial binaries.** The bridge now
  launches via `-preScript -noanalysis` (was `-postScript` with full analysis),
  so its TCP socket binds right after the binary loads — before analysis — and
  readiness is fast. Analysis runs afterwards as an unbounded TCP `analyze`
  operation (which also persists the program via `analyzeAll` + `save`),
  decoupling a **bounded launch** (JVM start + OSGi compile + load, capped by
  `launch_timeout_secs`) from **unbounded analysis**.
- Bridge launch/teardown can no longer hang or orphan a JVM. The JVM tree is
  spawned in its own process group and a launch failure/timeout kills the whole
  group (`killpg` on unix, `taskkill /T` on windows) **before** joining the
  output reader threads. Previously the readiness wait capped at 120s while
  analysis kept running, then killed only the `analyzeHeadless` wrapper (not the
  JVM grandchild) and blocked forever joining pipes the surviving JVM held open.
- `ghidra stop` now force-kills the whole bridge process group as a fallback,
  not just the JVM PID.
- `ghidra program close`, `program delete`, and `program export` now work — the
  Rust client was sending command names (`close_program`, `delete_program`,
  `export_program`) the Java bridge never registered, so they always errored.
- `--filter`, `--sort`, `--count`, and `--offset` are now honored on all list
  commands (`function list`, `strings list`, `symbol list`, `type list`,
  `query`, `dump`). The bridge only does a literal substring match on the name
  field, so ghidra-cli now fetches the full dataset and applies the real filter
  DSL, sort, pagination, and count client-side.
- Call-graph and callee traversal now find every call within a function body,
  not just calls at its entry point (the reference scan now iterates all
  reference sources in the function body).
- `program export --format binary` and the other native exporters no longer fail
  on Ghidra 12: the `Exporter.export` method is resolved by name + 4-arg arity
  rather than an exact `Program.class` signature that drifted across versions.
- Default project directory no longer breaks on Linux with Ghidra 12.1+, which
  rejects any project location containing a dot-prefixed path component
  (e.g. `~/.cache`). The default now falls back to `~/ghidra-cli-projects` when
  the cache path has a hidden component (macOS/Windows keep their cache-dir
  location).
- `ghidra project delete` now actually deletes the project. It removes the
  Ghidra `<name>.gpr` / `<name>.rep` artifacts (previously it looked for a
  non-existent `<name>` directory and silently deleted nothing) and stops any
  running bridge first so the project lock is released. `ghidra project info`
  likewise reports `Exists` based on those artifacts.
